Hello, world! This is my innagural post to my personal blog. More than an exercise in blogging, I am using this to play around with simple web and DevOps technologies. This static site is served via nginx and hosted on a VPS, which is [provisioned](https://github.com/ssoi/personal-deploy) using [Ansible](https://www.ansible.com/). The static site is generated using [Pelican](https://blog.getpelican.com/). Finally, the site itself is tested and deployed to the VPS using [Travis CI](https://travis-ci.org).

Ultimately I hope to continually update the site with posts with explorations in data science. One
can always dream...
