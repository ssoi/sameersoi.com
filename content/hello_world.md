Hello, world! This is my innagural post to my personal blog. More than an exercise in blogging, I am using this to
play around with simple web and DevOps technologies. The site is hosted on a VPS and the server is
[provisioned](https://github.com/ssoi/personal-deploy) using [Ansible](https://www.ansible.com/) with NGinx simply serving static files. The
content itself is generated using [Pelican](https://blog.getpelican.com/). The site itself is deploy
using Travis.

Ultimately I hope to continually update the site with posts with explorations in data science. One
can always dream...
